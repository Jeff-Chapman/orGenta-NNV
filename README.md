Self-organizing hierarchicial notekeeper for Windows

This is the repo for orGenta, a self-organizing outlining notekeeper for the Windows desktop. orGenta stores information in Categories, Items, and Notes. For examples of how orGenta works, please visit: https://izardsoftware.wordpress.com/

If you are interested in using this software, a link on the above website will send you an installable package with both the software and the Documentation.

If you are a software developer who would like to compile and run this code from scratch, simply clone the "main" branch of the repo to a new folder on your desktop Windows computer. Open the .sln file in Visual Studio and compile (build) it. After it finishes, you will need to copy the supporting database and text files from the "Runtime" folder of the repo into the same directory where your executable got built, and then you may run the software.

We welcome outside contributor C# developers to this project. If you are a U.S. citizen interested in helping us develop orGenta please follow the instructions in https://izardsoftware.wordpress.com/contributing-to-orgenta/.
